## What is it
Keep track of your daily goals or help build your habits by using GitHub style contribution charts.

I wanted to be able the idea with others, so you can create an account and participate yourself.

### Authentication
Authentication is handled via [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview). View their page to learn more about it. Some things you may be curious about:
1. "Data from Sign in with Google is not used for ads or other non-security purposes." - Google
2. Because we want you to be able to create charts, your email you authenticated with is stored to create an account.
3. No other items are stored or even accessed/viewed.
